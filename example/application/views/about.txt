Flooer Framework seek a view script file in the views directory
of an application and these are default view script files:

 1. layout.html
    A common view script file in an application
    for a global design and will layout a pre-rendered content.

 2. controllername.html
    A common view script file per a controller
    and used this file if a layout.html does not exist.

 3. controllername/actionname.html
    A view script file per an action
    and used this file if a controllername.html does not exist.

You can set a view script file in an action controller like this:

    $this->view->setFile('about.txt');

and Flooer Framework send a rendered content
with a suitable Content-Type header by the view script file extension.
